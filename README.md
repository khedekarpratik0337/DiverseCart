## Business Process
1) The sales team aims to gain insights into the company's performance by focusing on two key aspects: the sales of top-selling products and understanding customer buying patterns associated with these products.
2) The Human Resource and Payroll team seeks to analyze employee payments across various departments, considering both job titles and employment status (Full time or Part time). The objective is to gain insights into the distribution of payments within each department, distinguishing between Full-time and Part-time employees. This comprehensive view will assist the team in making informed decisions regarding department-specific hiring needs and determining appropriate compensation levels for different job titles and employment types.
3) The Customer Engagement team seeks to explore the correlation between product reviews and sales. The objective is to uncover patterns within customer reviews, distinguishing between positive and negative feedback, and establish connections between these patterns and specific products or product categories.
